# DataStructure-Codes
These are some basic Data Structure Codes which I did while learning DS for the first time. 

The codes are mostly divided in assignments and each assign have either a new topic or some hard questions on the topic of previous assignment.

There is some possiblity taht some of the codes may not be greatly optimized or some may even have errors or bugs. These are given since I coded these while
learning Data Structures and Algorithms for the first time.
